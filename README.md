# Cupon Data Anlysis
### Overview
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to answer the question "will the customer accept the cupon?" The EDA can be found in the jupyter notebook [coupons.ipynb](/coupons.ipynb)

The data source is a .csv file from UCI Machine Learning Repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk and can be found in the data folder.


### Findings
- Drivers who were driving alone and were not widowed like to use bar coupons
- Drivers under 30 prefer to do other things rather than going to a bar to use a coupon
- Drivers with lower income are not necessarily intersted in using bar coupons
